# ðŸ§  Pre-Market Options Data Solution Design

## The Problem
Pre-market hours: Options volume = 0, but traders need actionable insights for planning.

## Professional Platform Analysis

### Unusual Whales Approach
- **Daily Flow Snapshots**: Store end-of-day unusual activity
- **OI Delta Tracking**: Day-over-day, week-over-week position changes
- **Historical Pattern Matching**: "Similar setups in the past led to..."
- **Pre-market Correlation**: How equity moves affect existing positions

### ConvexValue Approach
- **Time-Series Dealer Analysis**: Track market maker exposure evolution
- **IV Term Structure History**: How volatility expectations evolved
- **Multi-Timeframe Context**: 1D/3D/1W/1M position analysis
- **Predictive Modeling**: What to expect when markets open

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Historical Data Pipeline
```
